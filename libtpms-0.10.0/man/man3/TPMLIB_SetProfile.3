\&\fB\s-1TPM_RESULT\s0 TPMLIB_SetProfile(const char *profile);\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fB\fBTPMLIB_SetProfile()\fB\fR is used to apply one of libtpms's provided profiles
to a \s-1TPM 2\s0 when it is started the first time. \fB\fBTPMLIB_SetProfile()\fB\fR must be
called after \fB\fBTPMLIB_ChooseTPMVersion()\fB\fR and before \fB\fBTPMLIB_MainInit()\fB\fR.
A profile may only be applied to a \s-1TPM 2\s0 and will always fail for a \s-1TPM 1.2.\s0
.PP
Once a profile has been set it will be used by the \s-1TPM 2\s0 from then on and
the profile will be carried along with the state of the \s-1TPM 2\s0 if the state
of the \s-1TPM 2\s0 was written using the callback registered with
\&\fB\fBTPMLIB_RegisterCallbacks()\fB\fR. Later attempts to set a different profile
for the same \s-1TPM 2\s0 instance using this \s-1API\s0 call will have no effect.
.PP
Libtpms v0.10 and later support several built-in profiles. The 'null' profile
provides backwards compatibility for libtpms v0.9 and only enables those
algorithm and commands that were available at that version of libtpms.
The default profile enables all currently available commands and algorithms.
Neither one of these profiles allows any modifications by the user. The
\&'custom' profile is the only one that a user may modify and where the user
may disable any commands and/or algorithms that can be disabled.
.PP
If a \s-1NULL\s0 pointer is given as a profile then the 'null' profile will be
used and only commands and algorithms of libtpms v0.9 will be enabled.
The state of such a \s-1TPM 2\s0 instance will be readable by the current version of
libtpms as well as later versions of libtpms and allow for downgrading
libtpms to version 0.9 from a later version.
.PP
Profiles with the prefix 'default' enable as many algorithms and commands
as possible. The 'default\-v1' profile, introduced with libtpms v0.10, allows
to run with libtpms v0.10 and later but will not allow to downgrade to
earlier versions of libtpms, such as v0.9.
.PP
A profile is a \s-1JSON\s0 map in string format. It must contain the 'Name'
field with the name of a known profile. It may contain a field
\&'Algorithms' that holds a comma-separated list of algorithms (verbs) to
enable or the field 'Commands' that holds a comma-separated list of ranges
of command codes to enable.
.PP
The following are examples of \s-1TPM 2\s0 profiles:
.PP

\&      "StateFormatLevel":2
\&     }
.Ve
.PP
The first profile selects the current default profile along with all
commands and algorithms that are available.
The second profile selects the \fIcustom\fR profile but restricts the
set of algorithms that the \s-1TPM 2\s0 provides to those ones that are listed.
Since 'sha1' and 'tdes' are missing in the list, it disables those algorithms.
Note that the \fIcustom\fR profile is the only profile that allows customizations
of enabled Algorithms, Commands, and Attributes (not shown here).
.PP
Only a subset of the implemented algorithms can be disabled. To determine
the list of algorithms that can be disabled, use the list of algorithms
return by \fITPMLIB_GetInfo(\s-1TPMLIB_INFO_RUNTIME_ALGORITHMS\s0)\fR in the
\&'CanBeDisabled' field. Similarly, only a subset of the implemented commands
can be disabled and \fITPMLIB_GetInfo(\s-1TPMLIB_INFO_RUNTIME_COMMANDS\s0)\fR can
be used to determine the list of 'CanBeDisabled' commands. No
attributes are enabled by default, so all of them can be disabled.
To see which attributes are implemented and can be enabled, use
\&\fITPMLIB_GetInfo(\s-1TPMLIB_INFO_RUNTIME_ATTRIBUTES\s0)\fR.
.PP
Since it is possible to disable algorithms that are mandatory for the
\&\s-1PC\s0 Client \s-1TPM 2,\s0 one can create a \s-1TPM 2\s0 instance that will cause
applications to fail. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully select which
algorithms to disable following the requirements of applications that will
be used. At the same time the choice of enabled commands is important
so that algorithms that are enabled can actually be used with the set
of enabled commands and applications do not fail unexpectedly because of
disabled commands. Therefore, determining the list of algorithms and
commands to enable and disable is left to the user.
.SH "StateFormatLevel"
.IX Header "StateFormatLevel"
The \fIStateFormatLevel\fR field exists in each profile carried by the
state of a \s-1TPM 2.\s0 The \fIStateFormatLevel\fR is an integer that is increased
whenever new \s-1TPM 2\s0 commands or algorithms are enabled for profiles. The effect
of this parameter is that a profile with \fIStateFormatLevel\fR 'n' will not be
accepted by a libtpms version that does not at least implement
\&\fIStateFormatLevel\fR 'n'. This prevents applications that may have used any newly
enabled algorithms or commands from failing because they try to use them
again with a \s-1TPM 2\s0 from a libtpms version that does not support them.
.PP
When the above is applied to a virtual machine environment then this means that
migrating the state of a \s-1TPM 2\s0 is only possible to a libtpms version that
implements at least the same StateFormatLevel. Therefore, care must be taken
which profile is chosen so that the profile's StateFormatLevel does not
become the obstacle for migrating the \s-1TPM\s0 state between different versions
of libtpms. This in turn means that in an environment where older libtpms
versions exist, which may be a target for migration, then the oldest
libtpms version's supported profile should be chosen. If libtpms v0.9
exists then this should be the 'null' profile, for libtpms v0.10 this can
be the the 'default\-v1' profile.
.PP
The following lists the meaning of \fIStateFormatLevel\fRs:
.IP "1: (since v0.10)" 4
.IX Item "1: (since v0.10)"
This \fIStateFormatLevel\fR is reserved for the null profile. Only algorithms
and commands supported by libtpms v0.9 are enabled. To remain compatible
with libtpms v0.9 state format, the null profile will not be written as part
of the state.
.IP "2: (since v0.10)" 4
.IX Item "2: (since v0.10)"
This \fIStateFormatLevel\fR enabled the writing of the profile as part of the
state.

ECC_Decrypt (0x19a).

now. \s-1RSA\s0 key OBJECTs may be 4 bytes bigger while others are smaller now.

A user may specify the \fIStateFormatLevel\fR when using the \fIcustom\fR profile.
In this case the given \fIStateFormatLevel\fR serves as the maximum
\&\fIStateFormatLevel\fR that the given algorithms and commands may require
(e.g., '2' would not allow to enable the command ECC_Encrypt, which
requires '3') or allows to enable key sizes, such as \s-1AES\-192,\s0 when for
example \fIStateFormatLevel\fR '4' is given. If \fIStateFormatLevel\fR '3'
is given then \s-1AES\-192\s0 will not be enabled.
